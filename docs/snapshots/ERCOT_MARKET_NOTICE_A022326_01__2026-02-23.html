    >    <p><strong>NOTICE&nbsp; DATE:</strong> February, 23, 2026</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE TYPE:</strong> M-A022326-01 Operations</p>
<p><strong>SHORT DESCRIPTION:</strong> Large Load Interconnection Studies update for Far West Texas region</p>
<p><strong>INTENDED AUDIENCE:</strong> Transmission Service Providers (TSPs), Interconnecting Large Load Entities (ILLEs), Resource Entities (REs), and other interested stakeholders</p>
<p><strong>DAYS AFFECTED:</strong> February 23, 2026</p>
<p><strong>LONG DESCRIPTION:&nbsp;</strong>Effective immediately, ERCOT requires Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) to include a no-solar scenario as part of Large Load Interconnection Studies (LLIS) for Large Loads proposing to interconnect within the list of counties identified in this Market Notice. &nbsp;This requirement applies to all LLIS studies that have not commenced or are currently in progress, as well as studies that have been approved under Section 9.4 of the ERCOT Planning Guide, but where the ILLE, as of the issuance of this Market Notice on February 23, 2026, has not met the requirements of Section 9.5.</p>
<p>As discussed at the February 2026 meetings of the ERCOT Board of Directors, ERCOT has identified an emerging reliability risk in Far West Texas of local load shed potentially being needed in the area during low wind conditions at night, especially during transmission and thermal resource outages (link to <a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2026/02/04/13-Far-West-Load-Growth-and-Transmission-Timing-Issues.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February 9, 2026 Board meeting Agenda Item 13 presentation</a>).&nbsp; This risk is expected to increase as additional loads are interconnected in this area.</p>
<p>Currently, most LLIS studies for Large Loads in the Far West do not include a no-solar scenario and thus do not fully reflect the impact of proposed Large Load additions on the emerging risk.&nbsp; In an effort to mitigate this risk going forward, ERCOT will not approve LLIS studies for Large Load additions in the Far West unless they include a no-solar scenario.&nbsp; Further, ERCOT considers the identification of this risk to be a material change that impacts one or more LLIS study assumptions for interconnection requests in the identified counties. &nbsp;Per paragraph (8) of Section 9.4 of the Planning Guide, ERCOT is requiring studies for Large Loads requesting to interconnect within the identified counties that have been approved under Section 9.4, but where the ILLE, as of February 23, has not met the requirements of Section 9.5. ERCOT may waive this requirement if it determines the proposed Point of Interconnection or Service Delivery Point is not expected to increase the reliability risk in Far West Texas.</p>
<p>TSPs performing the relevant LLIS studies should consult with ERCOT on study assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>List of Identified Counties:</strong>&nbsp; Andrews, Borden, Brewster, Coke, Concho, Crane, Crockett, Culberson, Dawson, Ector, Edwards, Fisher, Glasscock, Howard, Irion, Jeff Davis, Jones, Kinney, Loving, Lynn, Martin, Midland, Mitchell, Nolan, Pecos, Presidio, Reagan, Reeves, Schleicher, Scurry, Sterling, Sutton, Terrell, Tom Green, Upton, Val Verde, Ward, and Winkler.</p>
<p><strong>ACTION REQUIRED:</strong> Per paragraph (8) of ERCOT Planning Guide Section 9.4, TSPs for Large Loads requesting to interconnect within the identified counties that have LLIS studies that are not started or are currently in progress, as well as studies that have been approved under Section 9.4 of the ERCOT Planning Guide but where the ILLE , as of February 23, 2026, has not met the requirements of Section 9.5, must update the study to include a no-solar scenario. &nbsp;TSPs should consult with the ERCOT Large Load Integration team (<a style="color: #467886; text-decoration: underline;" href="mailto:largeloadinterconnection@ercot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largeloadinterconnection@ercot.com</a>) on study assumptions for the no-solar scenario.</p>
