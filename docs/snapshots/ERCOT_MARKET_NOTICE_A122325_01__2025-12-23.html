    >    <p><strong>NOTICE DATE:</strong> December 23, 2025</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE TYPE:</strong> M-A122325-01 General</p>
<p><strong>SHORT DESCRIPTION:</strong> ERCOT Large Load interconnection process stakeholder engagement plan and upcoming milestones regarding development of a proposed Batch Study process framework</p>
<p><strong>INTENDED AUDIENCE:</strong> Transmission Service Providers, Large Load Customers, and other interested stakeholders</p>
<p><strong>DAYS AFFECTED:</strong> December 18, 2025 - February 20, 2026</p>
<p><strong>LONG DESCRIPTION: </strong>On December 18, 2025, ERCOT presented an update on the Large Load interconnection process at the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) Open Meeting. (See Item 9 at <a href="https://www.adminmonitor.com/tx/puct/open_meeting/20251218/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdminMonitor 121825</a>.)&nbsp; The purpose of that discussion was to highlight the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The levels of Large Load interconnection requests are unprecedented, making historical processes to connect these Large Loads no longer appropriate. The rapid increase in Large Load interconnection requests has created structural challenges, including coordination across Transmission Service Providers (TSPs), repeated restudies, and a growing backlog of requests. These challenges have contributed to longer timelines and increased uncertainty for Large Load Customers and utilities.</li>
<li>Planning Guide Revision Request (PGRR) 115, implemented on December 15, 2025, is an improvement to the previous interim Large Load interconnection process, but these new regulatory changes are already insufficient to manage the increase in the volume of Large Loads that ERCOT is seeing.</li>
<li>Development of a new interconnection process- called the "Batch Study process"- is ERCOT's focus over the next several weeks.&nbsp; The high-level proposal of the Batch Study process is to group Large Loads that meet certain stringent requirements into a single study and allow existing and planned transmission capacity to be allocated and reserved, thus providing Large Load Customers with study efficiency, consistency, transparency, and certainty while maintaining a system-wide focus on reliability.</li>
<li>To inform the development of a Batch Study process framework, ERCOT, working with McKinsey and Company in a project management role, will conduct a defined, time-bound stakeholder engagement during January and February to gather perspectives on current pain points, priorities, and implementation considerations. Engagement will include: (1) targeted interviews with selected stakeholders such as TSPs and Large Load Customers; and (2) working sessions with a broader set of stakeholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Participation in these discussions is exploratory and non-binding and is intended to inform ERCOT's evaluation of potential process enhancements to develop a proposed Batch Study process framework.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ERCOT will further provide updates at the following meetings:</p>
<ul>
<li>January 15, 2026 PUC Open Meeting</li>
<li>January 21, 2026 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC)</li>
<li>January 22, 2026 Large Load Working Group</li>
<li>January 29, 2026 PUC Open Meeting</li>
<li>February 5, 2026 PUC Open Meeting</li>
<li>February 8-9, 2026 ERCOT Board of Directors&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>ERCOT plans to file a proposed Batch Study process framework for discussion at the February 20, 2026 PUC Open Meeting.&nbsp; Possible regulatory changes and implementation timelines will be discussed after the proposal is submitted.&nbsp; Any information regarding the Large Load interconnection process will be filed in PUC Project No. 59142, Review of ERCOT's Interconnection Processes for Large Loads.</p>
<p><strong>ACTION REQUIRED:</strong> ERCOT will immediately begin reaching out to certain TSPs, Large Load Customers, and other interested stakeholders to set up meetings in January.&nbsp; These meetings are likely to be located at ERCOT's Taylor Facility with a virtual option.&nbsp; ERCOT encourages those identified participants to quickly respond with availability since there will be limited dates and times in order to have as many meetings as possible with stakeholders.</p>
